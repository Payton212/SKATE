## Checklist

- [] users are prompted with a settings page to choose what difficulty obstacles and how many players will be skating

- [] difficulties (easy, medium, hard) 

- [] obstacles (flat ground, hubba, ledge, flat bar, manual pad, mini ramp, euro,)
   it should be noted that all tricks that are possible on flat ground will be possible on the euro and other similar obstacles like an  A-Frame or stairs etc.

- [] based on the selected settings a user will now be given the option to choose what kind of game they will be playing(game of skate,      practice)  

- [] if a user chooses to practice (this is what we're building right now) they then generate a trick and a trick is generated, if they chose obstacles the algorithm will add that into consideration and generate a trick to be done on the obstacle

- [] users will be allowed to mark if they miss the trick and have that trick put into an array of missed tricks to be stored in local storage

- [] once they have missed tricks in local storage they can then practice missed tricks and the tricks from the missed tricks array will then be the only tricks to be generated and if they log the trick as landed the trick will be deleted from the missed tricks array

- [] add a delete missed tricks to clear the missed tricks array from local storage 

    
 ## Description
        as a user i want to be prompted with a group of settings including (difficulty what obstacles i wish to use and if there are additional players or not) and after the settings are chosen i am then taken to a seperate page where i can see my listed settings and several boxes brealing down the trick along with one that tells what obstacle the trick is meant to be attempted on. after clicking the generate trick button I am then given a trick with a name what basic tricks create that  trick and an obstacle I am to attempt the trick on

        
          - the reaoson I built this is to have a fun project to work on that where i am familiar with the hobby and can use everytime i skate
          - this will help with boredom at the skate park and creativity issues when stuck on what to try or to try to learn
